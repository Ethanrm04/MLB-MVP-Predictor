#Proposed working project title

#Brief Background

#Question

Is it possible to predict the potential MLB and Cy Young Winners?
Are the winner/s of these awards chosen by statistics or popularity or a combination of both?

#Hypothesis and Predictions

##Hypothesis

A playerâ€™s offensive performance metrics (batting average, home runs, RBI, and on-base percentage) combined with advanced statistics (such as WAR - Wins Above Replacement) are strong predictors of winning the AL or NL MVP Award.

##Predictions

Using a combination of traditional baseball statistics and advanced metrics, it is possible to accurately predict the MLB MVP with a high degree of confidence.
